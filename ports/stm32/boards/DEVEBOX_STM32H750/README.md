# DEVEBOX_STM32H750

## Note

According to the datasheet, the stm32h750 has 128kbyte internal flash. These processors are intended to run from external qspi flash.

In practice, stm32h750 processors contain 2mbyte flash. Only 128kbyte is guaranteed. Flash above 128k is not factory tested. When flashing using gdb `load` command, check flash has been written correctly with the gdb `compare-sections` command.

This firmware assumes a stm32h750 with 2mbyte flash.

## Installing bootloader

-   download and unzip firmware
-   disconnect board from USB
-   connect pin BOOT0 with pin 3V3
-   connect board to USB
-   install bootloader:

        sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0x0483:0xDF11 -D mboot/build-DEVEBOX_STM32H750/firmware.dfu

-   disconnect board from USB

## Installing micropython

-   connect pin BOOT0 and 3V3
-   connect to usb
-   run `dfu-util -l`. The device should appear.
-   install micropython:

        sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0x0483:0xDF11 -D build-DEVEBOX_STM32H750/firmware.dfu

-   disconnect from usb
-   remove connection between BOOT0 and 3V3
-   reconnect to usb
-   device should appear

## DFU

-   connecting boot0 to 3V3 and flashing using dfu works fine. flashing using mboot sometimes hangs. 

-   you can boot in DFU mode by first connecting BOOT0 and 3V3, then connecting usb.

-   upgrade firmware over usb with 


        cd micropython/ports/stm32/mboot/build-DEVEBOX_STM32H750
        sudo dfu-util -a 0 -D firmware.dfu
        cd micropython/ports/stm32/build-DEVEBOX_STM32H750
        sudo dfu-util -a 0 -D firmware.dfu

    or from the source tree with 


        sudo make -C ports/stm32/mboot BOARD=DEVEBOX_STM32H750 deploy
        sudo make -C ports/stm32 BOARD=DEVEBOX_STM32H750 USER_C_MODULES=../../../extmod deploy

-   as a measure of last resort, you can boot in DFU mode by connecting BOOT0 and 3V3, connecting a usb-to-serial adapter to pins A9 and A10, and uploading firmware over DFU with the `stm32flash` command. You may need to compile `stm32flash` from source to get the latest version.

## SD card

The board does not have a "detect SD card present" pin. Manually write 0 to pyb.Pin.board.SD_SW to force pyb.SDCard().present() True.

    >>> import pyb
    >>> import os
    >>> pyb.SDCard().present()
    False
    >>> from machine import Pin
    >>> sd_sw = Pin(pyb.Pin.board.SD_SW, Pin.OUT)
    >>> sd_sw.value()
    0
    >>> pyb.SDCard().present()
    True
    >>> sd_sw.value(1)
    >>> pyb.SDCard().present()
    False
    >>> sd_sw.value(0)
    >>> pyb.SDCard().present()
    True
    >>> os.mount(pyb.SDCard(), '/sd')
    >>> os.listdir('/sd')
    ['bmp.py']

Put the SD cardâ€™s filesystem in the path list so Python scripts can be imported from the SD card.

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path
    ['', '/flash', '/flash/lib']
    >>> sys.path.append('/sd')
    >>> sys.path.append('/sd/lib')
    >>> sys.path
    ['', '/flash', '/flash/lib', '/sd', '/sd/lib']

The stm32h750 full speed usb supports only 2 virtual comm ports. (The stm32h750 has 2 FS USB ports, but only one is broken out to a usb connector)
